## Making The Environment

1. started with installing the vcpkg package manager.
2. ran the bootstrap script inside the new vcpkg directory.
3. ran ./vcpkg integrate install to integrate vcpkg with CMake. 
4. ran ./vcpkg install sfml to install the sfml graphics library.

## Getting The Display

1. Went through many hoops and hurdles to get CMake to recognize sfml.
2. Finally got a simple screen with a circle set up.
